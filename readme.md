I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Music. Parenting. Whatever.

Questions (issues) will be closed as I answer them so I can keep track but you can always comment on any so long as they are not locked. I reserve the right to decline to answer a given question.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
